## DATA
Data is in fasta format. We use Biopython to process it. The working example [pdb_seqres.txt](/tests/data/pdb_seqres.txt) has been downloaded from [2].

## Encofing sequence data
Showcasting three approaches to encode sequence data:
- Ordinal encoding DNA sequence
- One-hot encoding DAN sequence
- DNA sequence as a "language", known as k-mer counting
